# ISAT 340 Mini Project: Celebrities Web Page

Using database design and implementation knowledge, we used SQL and HTML/CSS to create a celebrities web page which lists short bios for celebrities that are populated from a database. We used Flask as a framework to be able to communicate between the web page and the database.
